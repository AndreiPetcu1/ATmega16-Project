# ATmega16 Project
This project demonstrates how to integrate Assembly and C programming languages to create a hybrid application on the ATmega16 microcontroller. The main goal is to leverage the low-level efficiency of Assembly while taking advantage of the modularity and readability of C.
Key Features: Efficient low-level hardware control using Assembly, Demonstrates cross-language function calls (ASM ‚ûù C), Fully compatible with AVR toolchain.
